# WireGuard installation and configuration - on Linux
Let me show you, how to install and configure a basic VPN connection with WireGuard on a Linux server and client. We will also have a look at some advanced configuration settings like keep-alive and traffic routing.

We will use the free and open-source VPN protocol WireGuard

## Prerequisites

- Linux Server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer

*For installing WireGuard on other Linux distriubtions or different versions than Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, follow the [official installation instructions](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).*

## Installation and Configuration

### Install WireGuard

To install WireGuard on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS we need to execute the following commands on the Server and Client.

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard wireguard-tools
sudo apt install openresolv
```

### Create a private and public key on Server & Client

Before we can establish a secure tunnel with WireGuard we need to create a private and public key on both, Server and Client first. WireGuard comes with a simple tool that can easily generate these keys. Execute this on the Server and Client.

```bash
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

Be aware, you ***MUST NOT SHARE*** the private key with anyone! Make sure to store it in a secure way on both devices.

### Configure the Server

Now you can configure the server, just add a new file called `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. Insert the following configuration lines and replace the `<server-private-key>` placeholder with the previously generated private key.

You need to insert a private IP address for the `<server-ip-address>` that doesn't interfere with another subnet. Next, replace the `<public-interface>` with your interface the server should listen on for incoming connections. 

```conf
[Interface]
PrivateKey=<server-private-key>
Address=<server-ip-address>/<subnet>
SaveConfig=true
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <public-interface> -j MASQUERADE;
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o <public-interface> -j MASQUERADE;
ListenPort = 51820
```

### Configure the Client

Now, we need to configure the client. Create a new file called `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. Insert the following configuration lines and replace the `<client-private-key>` placeholder with the previously generated private key.

You need to insert a private IP address for the `<client-ip-address>` in the same subnet like the server's IP address. Next, replace the `<server-public-key>` with the generated servers public key. And also replace `<server-public-ip-address>` with the IP address where the server listens for incoming connections.

*Note that if you set the AllowedIPs to `0.0.0.0/0` the client will route ALL traffic through the VPN tunnel. That means, even if the client will access the public internet, this will break out on the server-side. If you don't want route all traffic through the tunnel, you need to replace this with the target IP addresses or networks.*

```conf
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <client-private-key>
Address = <client-ip-address>/<subnet>
SaveConfig = true

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server-public-key>
Endpoint = <server-public-ip-address>:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```

Once you have created the configuration file, you need to enable the wg0 interface with the following command.

```bash
wg-quick up wg0
```

You can check the status of the connection with this command.

```bash
wg
```

### Add Client to the Server

Next, you need to add the client to the server configuration file. Otherwise, the tunnel will not be established. Replace the `<client-public-key>` with the clients generated public key and the `<client-ip-address>` with the client's IP address on the wg0 interface.

```bash
wg set wg0 peer <client-public-key> allowed-ips <client-ip-address>/32
```

Now you can enable the wg0 interface on the server.

```bash
wg-quick up wg0
```

```bash
wg
```
